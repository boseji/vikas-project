This project is dedicated to the Farmers of the Developing Countries Like India(Bharat). The primary objective of this project is to create an easy-to-use low cost computing device that can help the Farmers in their daily chores. The Following are the Details of the Features underlying this project:

To Provide Simple Calculator like Functions: The Farmers may recognize only numbers and some simple operators such as Additions, subtraction, multiplication & division. This device would look similar to a calculator and hence would be easy for them to operate.

1. Low Battery Power consumption and Hand-held Device: This device would be a AA Rechargeable type battery. The recharging can be done at the Government Terminal when the device is attached for data downloads.

2. Watch like Feature using Real Time Clock : This device would use the low power mode and the timers to give the functionality of a Real time Clock with date. The same can be updated whenever the Farmer connects the device to the Government Terminal (detailed in the below points).

3. Storage Feature for numerical data (Accounting, Crop rotation, Dates etc): Sometimes the Farmers would like to remember some Dates or Time or Numbers related to them or work. This device would help them by storing a limited number of entries of numbers or dates in the permanent storage such as an EEPROM.

4. Soil Humidity Finder and Water Level Monitoring: As an addon feature this device would be able to help the farmers in observing the Water level of a Tank or the Humidity in the soil.

5. Independent Terminal Functionality :-
    a. Government Terminal: This terminal would be a completely separate PC, installed in a Central facility provided by the Government to help the Farmers with additional information. This would be used to download Data and agricultural related information into the Hand held device. This terminal would also provide a free way to charge the Hand held Device.
    b. pump Controller: For Agriculture Pump sets, this hand held device can program the time of watering the fields as per the Electricity and Voltage.
